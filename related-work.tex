\emph{Related work.} Automata over infinite data words have been introduced to prove decidability of satisfiability for many kinds of logic: LTL with freeze quantifier \cite{DemriL09}; safety fragment of LTL \cite{Lazic11}; $FO$ with two variables, successor, and equality and order predicates \cite{BojanczykDMSS11}; EMSO with two variables, successor and equality \cite{KaraST12}; generic EMSO \cite{Bollig11}; EMSO with two variables and LTL with additional operators for data words \cite{KaraT10}. The main result for these papers is decidability of nonemptiness. These automata are ad-hoc, and often have complex acceptance conditions, while we aim to provide a simple and seamless nominal extension of a well-known class of automata. We can also cite variable finite automata (VFA) \cite{GrumbergKS10}, that recognize patterns specified through ordinary finite automata, with variables on transitions. Their version for infinite words (VBA) relies on B\"uchi automata. VBA are not closed under complementation and determinism is not a syntactic property. For our automata, determinism is easily checked and we have closure under complementation. On the other hand, VBA can express ``global'' freshness, i.e.\ symbols that are different from all the others.
