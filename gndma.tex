\begin{definition}\label{def:gndma}
 A \emph{deterministic \nomG-nominal automaton} is a tuple $(Q,\tr{},q_0,A)$ where:
 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $Q$ is an orbit-finite \nomG-nominal set of \emph{states}, with $q_0 \in Q$ the \emph{initial state};
%  
  \item $A \subseteq \Pow(\orb(Q))$ is a set of sets of orbits, intended to be used as an acceptance condition in the style of Muller automata.
%  
 \item $\tr{} \eqsub Q \times \names \times Q$ is an (equivariant) \emph{transition relation}, made up of triples $q_1 \tr{a} q_2$, having \emph{source} $q_1$, \emph{target} $q_2$ and \emph{label} $a \in \nomG$;
%  
\item the transition relation is \emph{deterministic}, that is: for each $q \in Q$ and $a \in \nomG$ there is exactly one transition with source $q$ and label $a$;
%  
%\item the transition relation is \emph{equivariant}, that is, invariant under permutations: there is a transition $q_1 \tr a q_2$ if and only if, for all $\pi$, also the transition $\pi \cdot q_1 \tr{\pi(a)} \pi \cdot q_2$ is present.
\end{itemize}
